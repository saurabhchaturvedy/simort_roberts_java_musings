
## 1.1 Review Generalization

## Important Points

- **Generalization** is an important concept in object oriented programming .
- Earlier inheritance was cool , and generalization was just a part .
- In java we can have generalization without inhertiance , using **interfaces** .
- **Java.lang.Object** is such a generalization .
- Such generalization can also be referred as a **bucket** , like putting things for categorizing them .
- Not everything is an object in java , like **primitives** .
- That's why we have **Wrapper** classes for them , like *Integer* , *Double*
- Java provides **autoboxing** and **auto-unboxing** , by which compiler allows us to convert from primitive to object or vice versa .
